suspend_notify
==============

Do you have a laptop?

Do you run linux?

Does your laptop randomly wakeup in your backpack and cook your pop-tarts?

If so, this product is for you! Play a sound when your laptop suspends or wakes up. Doesn't fix the root of the problem, but alerts you when your pop-tarts are done.

* Place poptart atop your keyboard
* Close your laptop
* Wait for Linux to randomly wakeup, you will be alerted by the sound of your choice.
* Enjoy your pop-tart

**tested on dell xps 15 w/ ubuntu 14.04**
